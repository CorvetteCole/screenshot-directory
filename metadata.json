This extension changes that to use whatever is set if you used the Gnome Screenshot app. This can be found in the dconf setting: /org/gnome/gnome-screenshot/auto-save-directory. If that directory doesn't exist, the extension will use the Home directory instead.\n\nNote: If the dconf setting doesn't exist, you need  to install the Gnome Screenshot app.\n\nThe idea was taken from the extension: Screenshot Locations.",
